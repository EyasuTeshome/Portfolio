# Personal Portifolio


In this project I used replicate one of Figma's template to create my own portifolio by using flexbox.

in this project I have used linter for HTML and CSS, to make sure there are no linter errors on the code. This portifolio website contains four sections:
1. header
2. home
3. about me
4. contact me
